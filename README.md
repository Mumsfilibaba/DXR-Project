# Personal Engine
This is a small personal engine created for testing different graphic techniques. The name may suggest that this is only for DXR, and that is why it was created in the first place, but it has evolved to be more than that.

**Current Features:**
* FXAA
* Deferred Rendering
* Normal mapping
* Parallax Occlusion Mapping
* Physically Based Rendering with Image-Based Lightning
* Shadow Mapping (Both Variance Shadow Mapping and "Traditional" is supported, and is selectable at compile time)
* Dynamic lights (Point-Lights, Directional-Lights, both with shadow support)
* Ray Traced reflections (Currently disabled)

**Planed:**
* Vulkan backend
* Better API abstraction
* Tiled Deferred Rendering
* SSAO
* Screen Space Reflections
* Cascade Shadow-maps
